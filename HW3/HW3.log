Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 7
In output file, /home/vibin/Desktop/sesh/sesh/Scriptsb/jcto//HW3/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: legal

In correct output file, line is: 4 2 4 4 illegal


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
