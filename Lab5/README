Lab 5: queueClient.c

FiLes included:
queue.h
queue.c
queueClient.c
README
Makefile
test-input.txt
test-output.txt

Looked up a bunch of stuff about more documentation, especially about how to format header files. I also consulted and based this lab off of one of my old labs from CE13, Lab5 which was about LinkedLists. I changed some stuff though so it ended up being pretty different though. I also looked up a lot of stuff about how to make a correct Makefile.
