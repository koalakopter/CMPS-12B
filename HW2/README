HW2: LinkedList and ChessBoard.jar
ID: 1585002

Looked for help regarding how to make Makefiles for files with multiple classes since my old makefile wasn;t working. Additionally, I looked up the syntax regarding how the .split() function worked. I also looked up how to use the .isUpperCase function for determining a piece's colour. I also probably looked up more bits here and there, but it was all just for how functions worked.

FILES PROVIDED:
NQueens.java
Makefile
README

Just type: "make"
and then "java -jar ChessBoard.jar <input.txt> and <output.txt>" just like in the last lab
