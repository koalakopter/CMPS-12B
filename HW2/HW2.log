=============================================
Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 0
In output file, ../../Repos/jcto/HW2/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: B n

In correct output file, line is: b n


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
