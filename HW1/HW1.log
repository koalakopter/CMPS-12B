=============================================
Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 0
In output file, /home/jayanth/Desktop/cmps12b/HW1_10/sesh/Scripts/jcto//HW1/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: 1 1 2 4 3 2 4 5 5 3 

In correct output file, line is: 1 1 2 3 3 5 4 2 5 4 


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
