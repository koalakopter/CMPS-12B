Looked for help online about using print to file functions, like out.println since it wasn't working from within a method. Additionally discussed the merits of using a 2-D array vs a 1-D array with a friend, Colin Mitchell. Also looked up documentation of how to convert strings into ints.

FILES PROVIDED:
NQueens.java
Makefile
README

TO RUN:
type "make"
run the command "java -jar NQueens.jar <input file> <output file>"
where input file consists of strings of 3 numbers, with the first number being the size of the board, second num the row of the first queen, and the final number the column of the 1st queen.
